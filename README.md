# QR Code Render Widget by Kai

A FlutterFlow-compatible widget that renders any text-based data into a QR code. Your data is never sent to a third party to generate the QR code. Perfect for data privacy and use cases with limited network connectivity. The anchors (corners) color is customizable via FlutterFlow editor UI.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the custom code `KaiQRCodeRenderWidget` into your project.
2. In your widget tree editor, look for it under Custom Code Widgets section and add it onto your widget tree as usual.
3. Select the newly added widget on the widget tree, provide the width, height and data values in the Custom Widget Properties section on the right pane. Note that the width and height value must be equal. You may also optionally set the color of the anchors/corners.
4. Run the project in Test mode or Run mode to see the results.

Now you have the locally-rendered QR code in your app. Enjoy!
